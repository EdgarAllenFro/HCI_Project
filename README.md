# HCI_Project
final project in human computer interactions

To run the application just download the whole folder, and then click on one of the .html files located within the "src" subfolder.
Since the whole project is in Javascript, html, and CSS, the file does not require being hosted by a server to be able to run properly
and can just be run locally on any system. 

The only dependencies in the code is how the different files are located in relation to one another. If this was changed then the datapaths
where a file calls another file would need to be changed as well.
